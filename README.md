# Phase-1-javascript-project

In this project, I am building a page where users can click on 3 different buttons and in turn will perform 3 different tasks. The page will fetch data from the public API in GitHub.  The API I will be using is the "[TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php)".  It contains different meal recipes that allow users to use to cook their meals.  For my websiteâ€™s MVP, I would like the user with minimal effort to enter a request/information and in return, the website will provide them with a dish recipe. They can keep pressing the button until they find the meal they want.

## What is the aim of this project?

The aim of this project is to demonstrate that data can be extracted from an API using JavaScript specifically using the syntax "fetch".  

## Why the project is useful?

This project shows that we can build any page by fetching data from any API and customising the website to be useful for the user.  In this case, we give the user 3 different buttons.  One to see a list of food categories.  Another button to show an alert.  The last button shows a random meal with ingredients and cooking instructions.
